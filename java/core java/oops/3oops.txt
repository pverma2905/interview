1)what is oops?
oops is a object oriented programing it is based o object.
rather then function and precedual
individual object are grouped into class

2)what are the main feature of oops?
. inheritence
. encapsulation
. polymorphism
. abstraction

3)what is an object?
it is a real world entity which is a basic unit of oops.

4)what is class?
it is template and blueprint describe the state/behaviour that the object of its type support

5)what is inheritence?
child class acquire the property of parent class by using extend keyword
advantage- code reusability

6)type of inheritence?
. single level
. multilevel
. hirarchical
. hybrid 

7)why multiple inheritence is not supported in java?
due to ambiguity issue java is not supported multiple inheritence 

8)what is encapsulation?
encapsulation is the process of variable and method in to single unit
advantage:security 

9)how to acheive encapsulation?
creating private variable in class
provide getter and setter method  

10)what is abstraction?
hiding the implementation details and providing only essential data to the user
advantage:security 
ex-atm machine

11)howto acheive abstraction in java?
abstract class(partail abstraction)
interface(pure abstraction)

12)what is abstract class?
13)what is interface?
14)Anyway we can't create object for abstract class and interface.But abstract classcontains constructor but interface not?
15)differnce b/w abstract class and interface?



16)what is polymorphism?

17)what are the type of polymorphism?


18)what is method overloading?


19)what is method overriding?


20)can we overload a static method in java?
21)can we override the static method in java?
22)can we override a private method in java?
23)what is covariant method overiding in java?
24)method overiding in java?
25)what is composition?
26)what is aggregation?
